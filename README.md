# 🕰️ Ubuntu CLI Date & Calendar Exercise

This repository contains a four-step command-line exercise designed to help new Ubuntu users (like Baqer!) fall in love with their terminal. Using only `date` and `cal`, you'll explore how to format dates, display time, and navigate calendars—all from the command line.

## 📚 Scenario

Baqer, a proud but frustrated Windows 11 convert, is struggling to appreciate Ubuntu. His friend Salib introduces him to the magic of `date` and `cal`. Baqer is intrigued, but soon wants more—and turns to you for help.

Your mission: write four precise commands using only `date` and `cal` to meet Baqer’s evolving needs.

## 🧪 Tasks

### 1️⃣ Format Today’s Date as `yyyy/mm/dd`
Example output:
```
2021/10/03
```

### 2️⃣ Display Full Day Name, Month Name, Day Number, and Full Time
Example output:
```
Sunday October 03 13:47:38
```

### 3️⃣ Show Calendar for Previous, Current, and Next Month
Output should include three months side by side.

### 4️⃣ Display Full Calendar for the Year 2070
Let Baqer see the year he believes he’ll pass away (hopefully not!).

## 🚫 Constraints

- Only `date` and `cal` commands are allowed.
- Do not use `cd` or any other command.
- Each command must be on a separate line.
- Submit either directly or via a `solution.sh` script.

Let the terminal win Baqer’s heart ❤️‍🔥
